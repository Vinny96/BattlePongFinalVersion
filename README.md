# BattlePongFinalVersion
A game built in Unity using C# that combines elements of brick breaker and pong. The objective is to get the ball past the enemy's zone, there are bricks that are 
flying through the middle to make this more challenging. However if you do destroy bricks you do get rewarded with a laser shot that you can use to hurt the 
opposing paddle.
